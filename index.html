<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my GitHub Page.</h3>

<p>This site is a brief summary of me and what I like to do, I recently moved to Chicago on a one way trip to attend Dev Bootcamp. Which is a 9 week crash course on web development. I've been on a Linux OS for about a year now, and I absolutely love it. So much easier to go to a repo if you need something and you get what you want, opposed to dealing with malware, spam, and toolbars I dont want. Ugh, good riddence windows! Anyways, I go by the old adjetive "If you do something you love, you will never work a day in your life". I love having the ability to touch peoples lives through something I built. In addition, coding is great for you mentally. Promoting mental acuity. </p>

<p>Although, I do miss Florida's sunny weather sometimes.</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Am I Here</h3>

<p>I love it all! Hardware, software, networks, servers, applications, switches, routers, OSs, APIs, . Its a good feeling that I am able to traverse the whole OSI model. I like talking about chipsets, I love how modular Ruby is with the use of Gems, it fasinates me how dynamicaly windowing will let a server spit out unack packets. The internet is truely something special, it can reach out and change peoples lives. Anything you want to learn is at the touch of your fingertips, and I am wholeheartedly glad to be apart of it.</p>
