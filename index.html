<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p>This site is a brief summary of me and what I like to do. I recently moved to Chicago on a one way trip to attend Dev Bootcamp. Which is a 9 week crash course on web development. I love spending time learning to code, but free time is always so limited and precious. I spent the majority on my technical life learning networking, it seemed like an easier field to break into with my background. But my passion for raw code kept sidetracking me, even leading me to an attempt to join the Navy. Until a friend suggested Dev Bootcamp, saying it will make me hirable within a few months. I was saving money for a new truck at the time, and I made the decision to make a change in my life for the better. I sold my truck, left my job as a yacht technician, and a few months later, here I am. I wanted to live by the old adage "If you do something you love, you will never work a day in your life".</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Am I Here</h3>

<p>I love it all! Hardware, software, networks, servers, applications, switches, routers, OSs, APIs, OOP. Its a good feeling that I am able to traverse the whole OSI model. I like talking about chipsets, I love how modular applications are with the use of APIs, it fascinates me how dynamically windowing will let a server spit out unack packets. The Internet is truly something special, it can reach out and change peoples lives. Anything you want to learn is at the touch of your fingertips, and I am wholeheartedly glad to be apart of it.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I have several years working in all aspect of the trade industry. From installing high end sophisticated electronics on million dollar yachts, to utilizing the heaviest of constructions tools while remodeling beautiful ocean front homes. During that time I have always been interested in working in an industry that connects people. The moving of information fasinated me, how you can be in the middle of nowhere and connect to a resource halfway around the world. I have a CompTIA A+ certification and I also made an attempt to aquire the Cisco CCNA certification about a year ago.</p>

<p>Our final project at DBC was <a href="http://artspace.herokuapp.com/">Artspace</a>, a web app that helps people rent single commercial spaces out hourly to practice their favorite art. Another group project was <a href="https://github.com/shidel-dev/snip-it">Snip-it</a>, which is a Pinterest style site that allows people to post or search for code snips and keep then on thier own personal board. And I am always working on something, feel free to check them out on GitHub.</p>
